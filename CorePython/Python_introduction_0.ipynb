    "The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 guiding principles or software design philosophies for writing computer programs in Python (it was intended to have 20 aphorisms, only 19 have been written down). It was written by Tim Peters, a prominent Python developer. These principles emphasize simplicity, readability, and elegance in code. \n",
